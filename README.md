THIS IS AN UNFINNISHED PROJECT, DO NOT EXPECT IT TO WORK.
this is a open source centrifuge design I'm making as a assessment project for my systems engineering class.

the premise is that one of my schools teachers needs a centrifuge to teach year 8's. he wants one that has a visible rotor and for it to be in use long after i have graduated.

i was given around 200 bucks and half a year to make this centrifuge and it's only now dawned on me that there may be someone somewhere that could use a open source centrifuge.

besides its going to be fun to document my journey as i learn how to use an Arduino properly.

i will leave the basic code blocks separate so i or anyone else can use them at a later date. 
while making this i want as many parts as possible to be switched out for whatever you have at home, i will note i with a * when i get around to it.


there will probably be a printable's project linked too, just for any models i end up making.


i will also note anywhere that needs improvement
